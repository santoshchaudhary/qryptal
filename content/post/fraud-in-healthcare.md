One of the areas where fraud is rampant and can have serious consequences is healthcare. Normally this manipulation of information is done for specific monetary gains — e.g inflating the bills for claiming a larger amount from insurance or medical reimbursement or even generating fictitious bills for procedures never carried out. There are also cases where doctors have been practicing impudently for years on the back of fake credentials and caused material damage to unsuspecting patients.

These are not stray cases. Such instances keep surfacing with regular frequency and contrary to popular perception, are not just confined to developing countries. Some of the cases involve high profile and public figures and the amounts in question could be substantial.

In addition, there is also an issue of productivity in case of medical claims processing. It involves a lot of paperwork especially in case of reimbursement of bills and it would help if there could be automated capture of the information into the processor’s system with zero or little manual intervention to eliminate errors and reduce the processing time.

In essence, it would make everyone’s task easier if they could a) trust the documents that they see with a quick and elegant way of verifying the details and then b) automate the transfer of this information into the processing system.
