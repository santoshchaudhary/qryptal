  This is Part 3 of a series of blog posts investigating university certificate fraud and potential solutions. This part provides an overview of our secure certificate generation solution and how it addresses the issues raised earlier. Part 1 explains the problem and Part 2 investigates typical solutions deployed by universities to address same.
At Qryptal, we have been working in this space for years and feel that an ideal solution to address this problem should have the following characteristics:

  To make it convenient to verify, many organisations have started incorporating QR Codes containing URLs on documents issued by them.
Examples are government issued licenses, inspection reports, insurance certificates, degree &amp; transcripts, pathology reports, receipts etc.
The idea is that when a third-party comes across this document, they can use any QR Code scanning App on their phone — scan the code and it will open the URL on the phone browser.

  For any system to function properly, we need to be able to trust and accept the parameters on which it is based. Lack of trust leads to people going down the wrong route or spending time and money to verify.
For example, take the legal system. We go to the courts to seek redressal of a wrongdoing or crime and the court takes into account the evidence that is presented and arrives at a conclusion.

  Credit analysis is an important part of regular bank financing. While doing a credit analysis, bankers and lenders have to rely on documents to support the claims as given by the entity being examined. For example : the banker will rely on warehouse receipts to certify the inventory of finished goods or raw materials including details like product, grade, quantity etc. This is important as the value of this inventory will determine the collateral that is available as security for the financing which is extended to the borrower

  Isn’t it ironic that we are talking about cheque fraud in an era of high technology and instantaneous payments ? Nevertheless this is a problem that is very real even in today’s world. Cheque fraud can be of several types — counterfeit or fake cheques, using a genuine cheque but forging the signature and finally altering details of beneficiary fraudulently. In this article we will mainly focus on the first problem of counterfeit or fake cheques.
